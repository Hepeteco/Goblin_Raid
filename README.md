This was a game that me and a friend developed for a third semester college project.

All of it was done within 8 hours, and it was one of my first projects!

The objective was to create a 2D game based on River Raid, we choose to use Goblin Raid as our main theme, and then construct a game based on that universe, we hope you enjoy it!

He was the artist and I was the developer!

See master branch for open code!
